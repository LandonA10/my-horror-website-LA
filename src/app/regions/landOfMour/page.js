                    background={"Welcome to the Land of Mour, a place of many ancient monsters called Horrors. You will see that these Horrors feast off the emotions of humans, making them extremely strong, and hard to combat against. Surviving against these creatures is extremely difficult to do, and rarely does any person make it out alive after encountering one. Besides the Horrors, The Land of Mour is home to many large forests, mountains, and lakes. Out of the 4 main regions, it is the largest and most populated, containing 5 major cities and home to about 2 million people."}
                    history={"The Land of Mour was the birthplace of the first human. Believed to be evolved from relative species, the first human opened its eyes in the early age around the year 700. As humans began to slowly cultivate their surroundings, conflicts started to arise. For about 150 years, Mour was a place of war and turmoil until a group of humans banded together and started to create a kingdom. The group later named themselves the Mour family (where the name Mour comes from), together they were able to create a system of peace and prosperity. \n\nThe Mour Kingdom was able to make great advances, becoming stronger and much greater than any of the other human kingdoms in the other regions, however that peace did not last forever. The kingdom had decided to cultivate and explore the giant forests of their homeland. The kingdom at this point in time was routed in the north and while the east and west sides of the forest had been explored, the southern side had been seldom explored due to the immense forestation which caused lots of explorers to disappear. Finally, one group of great explorers had made it to the fronts of the southern part of the forest. The southern part was very different and stood out from the rest of the forest, it was much darker due to the lack of sunlight and the vegetation was a lot more thick and dense. This made exploring it even harder than finding it. However, the explorers were determined to explore the forest and come out unscathed. \n\nOn the 13th day of the 3rd month of the explorers journey, they came upon a thick grove of trees, however these trees looked different, something was off. It seemed as if there were tall black figures hanging from the tops of the trees. The explorers slowly approached and as they walked closer, the light from their torches eventually hit one of the bodies on the trees. This single event would begin the Age of Cataclysm. As the light hit the face of the monster, it awoke. The events after are unclear, all that is known is that one explorer came back alive to tell the tale. But, it didn’t take too long to see the effects of the awakening of these new monsters, later named as Horrors. In fact, it wouldn’t just be Mour that would feel the wrath of these monsters, all around Mytharelm monsters that had been sleeping awoke after centuries, ready to wreak havoc on everything. \n\nEventually, the people of the kingdom began to be filled with hysteria, new groups started to form and it was becoming increasingly difficult for the Mour family to control everything. Soon, a civil war broke out and destroyed the kingdom entirely. After about 5 years of fighting, the Mour kingdom was split into 3 different kingdoms. The remaining Mour family stayed in the north and created the Northern Mour Kingdom. To the east and west, radical groups created their own kingdoms, however not one person settled into the southern part of the forest, later named the Forest of Horrors. That would be until one man did."}
                    geography={"The Land of Mour is in an abundance of forests, full of different plants, animals, and monsters. However, there is one forest that stands out amongst the rest… Some call it a place of death, misunderstanding, others call it Hell. It is the Forest of Horrors, the largest forest in the Land of Mour, home to the terrifying monsters, the Horrors. \n\nThe forest covers about 70% of the Land of Mour, within which lies only one town. People call these people insane, brave, or foolish, however these people have learned how to live with the Horrors. They are seldom seen. They are known to have a strange way of dress and speech, that even if one was seen, most would rather walk away and ignore that they even saw them. \n\nThe Land is also surrounded with great mountains stretching from border to border. Within these mountains lie civilizations that were sick of the green of the forests and instead wanted the freshness of the air. However, these mountains aren’t freed from the Horrors below either, they too have their fair share of creatures. Some of the tallest peak of these ranges is said to be home to most of these creatures, as those who hike through this peak, or merely pass it, say that they can hear the screeching equivalent to nails on a chalkboard."}
                    exploration={"When entering the Land of Mour, it is best to visit the most popular city. The Land of Mour is surrounded by mountains, while the inside is full of forests. Entering through the north is best, as the most abundant city lies right there, and not much forest travel is required. Most of the political unrest lies in the east and west. The forest of Horrors lies in the south. \n\nRefrain from going even remotely near the forest of Horrors, as monsters sometimes like to travel on the outskirts. For the most part, most monsters live in the Forest of Horrors, however it’s not uncommon to see some monsters roaming around in neighboring forests. Make sure to carry a weapon, and always be aware of your surroundings. \n\nThere are numerous roads connecting each town to each other, however there is one main road governed by the 3 biggest kingdoms in the North, East, and Western forest areas. It is recommended to take it as it’s the safest way for travel"}
